# Egg Categories:

#As part of your Egg Money statement we've sorted your transactions into eight main spending categories to give you an overview of how your money is being spent.

#Essentials - the things you need for daily living such as food and drink from local stores and supermarkets. Your personal finances are also included.
#High street & web - less frequent purchases from high street retailers and direct or online stores. This category would include shopping for clothes, books and music.
#Travel & transport - anything to do with getting around (by car, bus, train or plane). Nights away from home and holiday bookings are also included.
#Household - household services and anything else you spend on the upkeep of your home.
#Going out - any spending you make when you go to restaurants, pubs or clubs, plus any leisure activities.
#Abroad - any transactions made outside the UK.
#Cash - cash withdrawals from your Egg Money account.
#Other stuff - anything that's not covered elsewhere, like business expenses or healthcare costs.

# When you're moving money around or making payments into the account, we've left the category line blank because this is not part of your spending.
